Sometimes you will want to create a duplicate entry for a camera. Perhaps you have a new camera that uses almost the same details and you want to save typing them in again. This is really easy to do:

 * Make sure you are looking at a list of your cameras.
 * Tap the `Edit` button on the top right.
 * `Duplicate` will show up in the toolbar at the bottom, tap this.
 * Now tap on the camera you would like to Duplicate.
 * An "Add Camera" screen will show up with all the same details as the previous camera, with "(Duplicate)" added to the camera's name.
 * Make any changes you would like and tap `Done`. If you change your mind, simply tap `Cancel`.
