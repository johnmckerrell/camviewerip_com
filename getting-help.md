If you can't find the information you're looking for on this site then you are best to report a problem through the app, or if you've previously done this then reply to the email you received and I will respond personally.

## Reporting a Problem Within the App

If you have trouble connecting to a camera then you will be offered the chance to "Report a Problem", you can also do this when looking at the list of cameras, simply tap the "Report a Problem" button and then tap on the row for the camera you're having problems with.

You will have the chance to enter a description of the problem you're having. If you provide an email address then I will actually be able to respond to you and try to help you resolve the problem. The app also makes it easy for you to choose to send me the login details for your camera so that I can try accessing it myself and see what the problem is.
