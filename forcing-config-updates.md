title: Â Forcing Config Updates
---

The app will check for a new config file once a day. This can allow me to add support for new cameras without having to push a new version of the app through the app store. Generally you don't need to force the config but if I've just added a camera and I want you to try it out straight away, you'll want to follow these instructions:

 * Tap on **Settings** in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen when looking at a list of cameras.
 * Turn the **Force Config Download** option to **On** or **1**.
 * *That's it!*

There is not currently any visual indication that the config has been updated. When you next enter the settings you will find that the **Force Config Download** setting is off again. This is normal, you would only need to turn it on again if you need to download the config again.
