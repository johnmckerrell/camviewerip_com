title: Â Step By Step Guide
---

This page aims to outline a step-by-step guide for getting your camera connected via the internet and using it with CamViewer.

With some cameras, most notably Tenvis cameras, you will find a web address written on the camera. It will most likely be some letters, followed by a small gap, then tenvis.info:
 * http://----   .tenvis.info [INSERT PICTURE]

With these cameras you may find that simply by turning them on and plugging them into your router using a network cable you will be able to access the camera using the address on the sticker.
