title: Â John McKerrell

I am John McKerrell, the developer behind CamViewer.

I have no affiliation with any of the manufacturers of the cameras although I am in contact with a few of them.

I hope you enjoy using the app, I try to make an app that I would like to use. This usually results in a good interface that people are happy to use although there can be some variances. Day-to-day I can only fully test with the cameras that I own myself but I do try to test against other cameras too where possible.

If you're interested [I have a blog](http://johnmckerrell.com/) and [I'm on twitter as @mcknut](http://twitter.com/mcknut).
